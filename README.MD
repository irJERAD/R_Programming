README

A collection of **R** programs used while working through personal Blog on Turning Theory into Application.

I plan to take theory learned in my math studies and apply them to real-world problems in an attempt to better understand techniquies and skills in data analytics, discovers, and interpretation.

I would also like to find place for behavioral analysis in some fundamental piece such as **Game theory** or **Social Graph theory**

Given these projects are intended for a broad audience, visualization will also play a key role.

As I acquire more practical experience with the **R Language** beyond the lab and research settings of my main use at **UCSD** I will have a better idea as to whether visualizations will be done in **R** or my usual go to visualization techniques using the **Processing Language**

Really far down the line I would love to build an intelligence engine which can assist with my fantasy football endeavors as I seem to be a complete **NULL** acting on my own intuition.
